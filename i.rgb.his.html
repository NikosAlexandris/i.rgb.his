<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p><em>i.rgb.his</em> is an image processing program that processes three input
images as red, green, and blue components and produces three output images
representing the hue, intensity, and saturation color properties.</p>

<p>The output images base upon a standard red-green-blue (rgb) to
hue-intensity-saturation (his) color space transformation.  Hue ranges in
degrees [0, 360] while intensity and saturation range in [0, 1].</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>The module supports various bits per image (as in bits per color channel,
bitness ranging in [2,16]).</p>

<p>It is possible to process three bands with <em>i.rgb.his</em> and recover the
original bands, nearly identical, with <em>i.his.rgb</em>.

Due to rounding, minor loss of precision is expected. Cell values will be
reproduced exactly after transformation in both directions, within plus or
minus 1.</p>

<p>Each output raster map layer is given a linear gray scale color table.  The
current geographic region definition and mask settings are respected.</p>
